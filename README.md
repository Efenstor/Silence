<p><b>NOTE</b>:
This fork of Silence was made solely to implement a temporary workaround for the presumed bug in ContentResolver.query which causes the selectionArgs parameter to be completely ignored, which inherently disables such features as repeated calls (those are being always rejected) and phone numbers found in messages. This problem is present only in some versions of Android 12 and 13, particularily in LineageOS 19.1 and 20.0 GSI.

<b>By default numbers not in your contacts are blocked.</b>

Optionally allow:
* Numbers you have contacted
* Numbers within the selected groups
* X registered call(s) from the same number within a set amount of minutes
* Numbers found in messages
* and more..

If the app rejects calls from contacts on Android 10, allow _Contacts_ permission manually in 
`App info â†’ Permissions`.
